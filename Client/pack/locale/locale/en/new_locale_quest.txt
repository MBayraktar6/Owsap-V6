1613	Land Agent:
1614	I'm just the Land Agent and therefore I can't[ENTER]lower the price. You need more Yang.
1615	The guild has purchased the land!
1616	Come again when you have decided what to do.[ENTER]First come, first serve.
1617	I'm the Land Agent and responsible for selling[ENTER]land. Before the monsters occupied the region in[ENTER]the middle of the continent, we did not have[ENTER]shortage of land and everyone was happy. So now[ENTER]I'm only selling land to guild leaders, who use[ENTER]it as land for their guilds. Do you want to buy[ENTER]some land?
1618	I already told you, I can't sell land to[ENTER]everybody. I hope you understand.
1619	A guild that already owns land cannot buy another[ENTER]piece of ground.
1620	An error occurred during the processing of this[ENTER]order.
1621	To buy this estate, the guild's level has to be[ENTER]over %s. The price is %s.
1622	Your guild hasn't reached the required level yet.[ENTER]I'm sorry.
1623	Do you want to purchase this land?
1624	This piece of land has already been sold to[ENTER]another guild. I'm sorry.
